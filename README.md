Our open-source project introduces a cutting-edge continual learning model, named DER+LwF, aimed at overcoming a significant challenge in deep learning: catastrophic forgetting. Through thoughtful design, this model not only seamlessly integrates classical and modern neural network architectures, including Swin Transformer, ViT, and Xception, but more importantly, it offers an efficient way to adapt to continuous streams of incoming data, significantly enhancing the model's performance in dynamic environments.

Our research, benchmarking against ten advanced deep learning models, has identified the Swin Transformer as our baseline model. Building on this, the DER+LwF model demonstrated remarkable compatibility with different deep learning architectures, especially when combined with the Swin Transformer, achieving significant accuracy improvements in incremental learning scenarios. These achievements not only signify a major advancement in addressing the issue of catastrophic forgetting but also open up possibilities for applying high-performance continual learning models in resource-constrained settings, such as actual agricultural production.

Although challenges remain in achieving accuracy rates above 90% and further reducing training times, we believe that through collaboration within the community and further research, we can overcome these limitations and take our model to new heights. We warmly invite researchers and developers worldwide to participate in this open-source project, to jointly explore the future of continual learning, and to realize its potential across various application scenarios.
